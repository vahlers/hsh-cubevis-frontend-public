# hsh-cubevis-frontend

HsH Master Project "CubeVis" Frontend.

## Running the stable application

To run the application in a stable way, you should **not** use `npm start` as it includes hot module reloading etc. This is more appropiate for developing purposes. *Instead*, you can use one of the two scripts provided under [/scripts](/scripts). `run-container.[sh|bat]` downloads the latest version from the GitHub Package Registry. `build-and-run-local.[sh|bat]` builds the container on your machine and then runs it. This will take a lot of time (5-10 min) and memory (2-4 GB). 

**If possible, use `run-container.[sh|bat]`.**
Hint: You need to sign in into the Docker Registry from GitHub. [Click this link for a tutorial.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to check for errors.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## IDEs

I'd recommend using VS-Code to work on this project with the ESLint extension installed.
